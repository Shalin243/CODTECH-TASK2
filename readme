Overview of the Project

Project:Vulnerability Scanning Tool

Objective

The objective of this project is to scan a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions,and misconfigurations.

Key Activities

1. Network Scanning: The tool scans the network for hosts, open ports, and services running on those ports.
2. Port Scanning: The tool scans the identified open ports to identify the services running on those ports.
3. Service Identification: The tool identifies the services running on the scanned ports, such as HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.
4. Vulnerability Detection: The tool detects potential vulnerabilities in the identified services using various methods.
5. Vulnerability Classification: The tool classifies the detected vulnerabilities based on their severity.	
6. Reporting: The tool generates a report detailing the scanned network, detected services, and identified vulnerabilities.

Technology Used

 Python: The primary program language used because of its easy syntax, fast execution, large community, Flexibility.
 Libraries:Requests,sockets.

Key Insights

1. Security Posture: Determine the overall security posture of the network, including patch levels, configuration settings, and security controls.
2. Threat Actor Identification: Identify potential threat actors that may be targeting the organization.
3. Performance Optimization: Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize system performance.
4. Cost Savings: Identify areas where costs can be reduced or optimized.
6. Risk Management: Provide a risk-based approach to vulnerability management, prioritizing remediation efforts based on risk severity.

This project provides a comprehensive  valuable insights into the security posture of their networks, systems, and applications. By identifying vulnerabilities and prioritizing remediation efforts, organizations can reduce the risk of successful attacks and minimize the impact of a breach.
